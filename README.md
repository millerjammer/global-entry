Super simple Node.js app to get you that Global Entry appointment.

I'm sure the 4 hours I spend developing this will pay for itself after a few trips.  Hell, this wasn't even for my apointment, it was for my son!  

Anyway, this app queries CBP for the appointment locations then allows you to monitor 3 of those locations by querying their API every 5 
seconds.  If availability is found you get a green background and some fireworks sound effect. You'd better act fast, I had 3 hits that failed before
I got an appointment.  I not sure what you'd do if you were just a normal human.
